# WordPress policy dashboard

`wp-settings` gives one compact view of non-secret WordPress policy and selected effective wp-config behavior.

```bash
./presswarden wp-settings example.com
./presswarden wp-settings all
```

A single website shows the full grouped policy. A fleet target shows three compact baseline groups (Security, Updates, Runtime) and only websites that differ from the unique most-common value. A tied fleet value is reported as `MIXED`; PressWarden does not choose an arbitrary winner. Fast and Full include this same read-only policy check and do not modify settings.

The fleet baseline is a statistical comparison aid, not a security standard or proof that the common value is correct. Policy differences are informational. Existing dedicated security checks can still produce findings for settings such as debug exposure, dangerous repair/upload flags, or missing file-modification lockdown.

## What is shown

The dashboard allowlist includes:

- file modifications and dashboard editor
- core/plugin/theme automatic-update policy and global updater blockers
- WP-Cron / alternate cron
- Recovery Mode / fatal-error handler
- environment type and development mode
- debug, debug log/display, query logging and script debug
- FORCE_SSL_ADMIN and WP_CACHE
- revision policy, trash retention, autosave interval and WordPress memory limits
- DB charset/collation posture
- WP_HOME / WP_SITEURL / cookie-domain override presence
- filesystem method
- WP_ALLOW_REPAIR, ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS, DISALLOW_UNFILTERED_HTML and WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL

The collector emits only normalized allowlisted values. It intentionally does **not** emit DB credentials, salts/keys, API tokens, FTP credentials, proxy credentials, arbitrary constants, source code, plugin output, or wp-config bodies.

The policy collector runs once per selected WordPress installation through WP-CLI with plugins/themes/packages skipped. WordPress still boots, and MU plugins or other early bootstrap code are not sandboxed. Malformed or contaminated output makes the check `INCOMPLETE` rather than clean.

## Changing supported settings

Changes use the same website-name / directory / `all` target resolver as `lock`, `unlock`, and `auto-updates`. They require explicit confirmation in an interactive session. PressWarden backs up each `wp-config.php`, applies the selected constant through WP-CLI, verifies the resulting value, and restores the backup when verification fails.

```bash
./presswarden wp-settings set editor disabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set editor enabled example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set cron disabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set cron enabled example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set recovery enabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set recovery disabled example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set environment production example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set environment staging example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set environment development example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set environment local example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set development disabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set development core example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set development plugin example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set development theme example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set development all example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set debug disabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set debug enabled example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set force-ssl-admin enabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set force-ssl-admin disabled example.com

./presswarden wp-settings set alternate-cron disabled example.com
./presswarden wp-settings set alternate-cron enabled example.com
```

Disabling WP-Cron does not create a server cron job; confirm an external scheduler invokes `wp-cron.php` as intended. Alternate WP-Cron is a compatibility workaround rather than a default hardening recommendation. Enabling the dashboard editor does not override `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS`; a locked site remains effectively unable to use the editor.

`WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=development` or a non-empty `WP_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` can make WordPress enable `WP_DEBUG` when `WP_DEBUG` is not explicitly defined. The dashboard reports the resulting effective debug posture.

## Read-only inventory fields

Cache, revisions, memory limits, DB charset/collation, URL/cookie overrides, filesystem method, repair/upload flags and external-HTTP blocking are intentionally inventory-only in this release. These values can be host-, plugin-, or application-specific, so PressWarden does not offer generic fleet-wide mutation for them.

Core/plugin/theme automatic updates keep their existing dedicated commands:

```bash
./presswarden auto-updates status example.com
./presswarden auto-updates core minor example.com
./presswarden auto-updates plugins enable example.com
./presswarden auto-updates themes disable example.com
```
